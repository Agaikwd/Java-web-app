<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<a>Fight, we will fight right</br>
Living low in a world of our own</br>
Destined to live right</br>
We're taking hell as our home</br>
Burning lives burning</br>
Asking me for the mercy of god</br>
Ancient cries crying</br>
Acting fast upon the way of the dog</br>
Welcome to hell</br>
Welcome to hell</br>
Welcome to hell (hell)</br>
Kill, we will kill, death</br>
Masturbating on the deeds we have done</br>
Hell commands death kill</br>
Argue not or feel the death of sun</br>
Burning, lives burning</br>
Asking me for the mercy of god</br>
Ancient cries crying</br>
Acting fast upon the way of the dog</br>
Welcome to hell</br>
Welcome to hell</br>
Welcome to hell</br>
Welcome to hell</br>
The Lord's my shepherd, I shall not want</br>
He maketh me in green pastures to lie</br>
And leaves me beside the waters in peace</br>
Leave your souls at his feet</br>
Kiss the flames, scorn defeat</br>
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death</br>
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me</br>
Die, we won't die, live</br>
Our choice of difference is what you'll never know</br>
Mortal voids, live, die</br>
Buried deep beneath the fall of the snow</br>
Burning lives ending</br>
Asking me for the mercy of god</br>
Ancient cries crying</br>
Acting fast upon the way of the dog</br>
Welcome to hell</br>
Welcome to hell</br>
Welcome to hell</br>
Welcome to hell </a>
